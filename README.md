##Introduction

This is the open repository for my What's APP link and media building WebAPP, it's the frontend for an upcoming tool. It's meant to allow the 
user to easily create plataform and user friendly URL/Button for sharing someone's What's APP contact as a link. 

It also provides a small tool to help in the creation of richer messages and a bit of documentation on What's APP messaging capabilities
